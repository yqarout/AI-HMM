# AI-HMM
Implementation of novel Bayesian nonparametric hidden Markov models which can leverage discrete contextual variables. Conventional HMMs are good at discovering interpretative time series clusters, AI-HMMs allow for HMMs to leverage additional discrete inputs, such as time of day and learn different transition dynamics for each additional category of context.
